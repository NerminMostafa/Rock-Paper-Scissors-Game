# Rock Paper Scissors Game
The game is a simple yet classic hand game typically played between two people, in this case, you and the computer. 

The game consists of three possible moves, each defeating one of the others:

1. Rock: represented by a closed fist.
2. Paper: represented by an open hand.
3. Scissors: represented by a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V.

The basic rules are straightforward:

- Rock crushes Scissors (Rock wins against Scissors).
- Scissors cuts Paper (Scissors wins against Paper).
- Paper covers Rock (Paper wins against Rock).
  
The game starts with both you and the computer simultaneously choosing one of the three moves. The winner of each round is determined based on the interactions between the chosen moves. If both players choose the same move, the round is a Draw.
